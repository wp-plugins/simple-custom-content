Simple Custom Content is the easy way to add custom content to your posts and feeds.

== Description ==

[Simple Custom Content](http://perishablepress.com/simple-custom-content/) enables you to add custom content to all of your posts and all of your feeds, and provides several shortcodes for adding custom content in specific posts, pages, and just about anywhere in your theme. Ideal for adding copyright information, distribution policy, thank-you messages, custom links, special offers, etc.

**Options**

For each of the "all-posts" and "all-feeds" options, you can specify where you would like to display the custom content:

* At the beginning of the post or feed
* At the end of the post or feed
* At both the beginning and end of the post or feed
* Or do not display custom content (disable)

For the shortcodes options, you basically get to add custom content for the following shortcodes:

* `[scs_feed]` - custom content displayed wherever the shortcode is included in feed items
* `[scs_post]` - custom content displayed wherever the shortcode is included in posts
* `[scs_both]` - custom content displayed wherever in both posts and feeds
* `[scs_alt]` - bonus shortcode that displays custom content wherever you want

Additionally there is a "Restore Default Options" setting that basically does what it says.
